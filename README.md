RISCV core unit verification system

RI5CY core from pulp-platform is used. RI5CY is a 4-stage in-order 32b RISC-V processor core. The ISA of RI5CY was extended to support multiple additional instructions including hardware loops, post-increment load and store instructions and additional ALU instructions that are not part of the standard RISC-V ISA.
